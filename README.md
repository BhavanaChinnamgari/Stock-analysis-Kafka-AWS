# Stock Market data Analysis using Kafka and AWS
This project sets up a real-time stock market data pipeline using Kafka and AWS. It involves creating an EC2 instance, setting up Kafka and Zookeeper, and configuring a topic for stock data. Data is sent via Kafka to an S3 bucket. AWS Glue is used to crawl the data, and AWS Athena enables querying the data stored in the S3 bucket. The system automates stock data collection and analysis in the cloud.
